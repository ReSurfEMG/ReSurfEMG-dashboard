# ReSurfEMG-dashboard

Dashboard to use the ReSurfEMG library

## Getting started

This dashboard requires that you have an environment with certain depedancies including dash. We reccomend that you do the following:

    Install all Python packages required, using conda and the
    `environment.yml` file.
   * The command for Windows/Anaconda users can be something like:
     `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
   * Linux users can create their own environment by hand.

Once you have entered an environment with the neccesary packages, run python index.py and a url for the dashboard should appear.
